German Grammar Practice

This is the code for the German Grammar Practice App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.com.inmune)
It's a relatively old codebase, and even uses some deprecated classes (like HttpClient).

The most interesting stuff is probably the grammar generation part, the scaffoliding for the rest of the application cancould be greatly improved.

I'm releasing this so that others can improve on it, I don't have time to maintain it anymore unfortunately.
